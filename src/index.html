<p>This sauce is good on almost anything - try it on fish, chicken, lamb, pork, and other vegetables.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Artichokes_with_Egg-Lemon_Sauce_(Aginares_me_Avgolemono)" target="_blank">Artichokes with Egg-Lemon Sauce (Aginares me Avgolemono)</a></strong></p><p>

For the artichokes:<br>
4-6 globe artichokes<br>
Juice of 1 lemon</p><p>

For the sauce:<br>
1 1/2 cups (375 ml) chicken or vegetable stock<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) cornstarch (cornflour) mixed with<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) cold water<br>
3 eggs<br>
Juice of 1 lemon<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

Cut off the artichoke stems close to the base. Cut about 1 inch (3 cm) off the top and trim the remaining leaf ends with scissors. Place in a large pot and cover with salted water, add the lemon juice, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer covered for 45 to 60 minutes, until the bottom leaves come away easily. Remove the artichokes from the water and drain upside down. Transfer to serving plates and keep warm. Meanwhile, bring the stock to a boil in a small pot over high heat. Stir in the cornstarch mixture and stir until thickened. Let boil for 1 minute. Beat the eggs until they are light and fluffy. Add the lemon juice gradually, beating constantly. Add the boiling stock gradually, beating constantly. Transfer the sauce to the pan and heat for 1 to 2 minutes, beating constantly - do not boil. Season with salt and pepper and spoon over the artichokes. Serves 4 to 6.</p></div>

<p>These crispy little pies are served in just about every home, restaurant, and <em>taverna</em> in Greece. If using frozen phyllo dough, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Cheese_Pastries_(Tiropites)" target="_blank">Cheese Pastries (Tiropites)</a></strong></p><p>

8 oz (225 g) ricotta or cottage cheese<br>
8 oz (225 g) feta cheese, crumbled<br>
3 eggs, lightly beaten<br>
3 Tbs (45 ml) finely chopped fresh parsley<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
3/4 lb (340 g) phyllo dough (about 20 sheets)<br>
1/2 lb (225 g) butter, melted</p><p>

Mix together the cheeses, eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper. Cut the phyllo sheets crosswise into 3 rectangles. Place a rectangle on a work surface and gently brush with melted butter. Place about 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of the cheese mixture on one corner. Fold the rectangles in half lengthwise to cover the cheese mixture. Fold the corner with the cheese mixture diagonally to make a point, and continue folding and rolling the triangle until the entire piece of dough is wrapped around the filling. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. (The tiropites may be frozen at this point and baked directly from the freezer.) Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and brush with melted butter. Bake in a preheated 425F (220C) oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes about 60.</p></div>

This tangy dip is popular in the Macedonian region of northern Greece, and similar dishes exist in nearby Turkey and throughout the region. Serve it with thick slices of toasted country-style bread or with pita rounds.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Feta_Spread_(Htipiti)" target="_blank">Feta Spread (Htipiti)</a></strong></p><p>

1/2 cup (125 ml) extra-virgin olive oil<br>

The Swiss have their fondue, the Mexicans have <em>queso fundido</em>, and the Greeks have <em>saganaki</em>. A visit to a Greek restaurant anywhere in the world is likely to feature waiters setting this dish ablaze and parading it through the room, accompanied by an appreciative <em>OPA!</em> from the guests.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Fried_Cheese_(Saganaki)" target="_blank">Fried Cheese (Saganaki)</a></strong></p><p>

4 Tbs (60 ml) butter<br>
1 egg, well beaten<br>
1 tsp (5 ml) flour<br>
1/2 lb (250 g) kasseri cheese* sliced 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) brandy<br>
Juice of 1/2 lemon</p><p>

*Available in finer supermarkets and Middle Eastern specialty shops. Parmesan or Romano cheese may be substituted.<br>
Heat the butter in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat. Beat the egg and flour together and dip the slices of cheese slices in the mixture. Fry until well browned on both sides. Remove from the heat and add the brandy. Carefully ignite the brandy with a match, and shake the skillet until the flame is extinguished. Squeeze the lemon juice over the cheese and serve from the skillet along with crusty bread. Serves 6 to 8.</p></div>

Small, light-green peppers are a common appetizer in Macedonia. They can be prepared in advance and served cold, but they taste best when still warm from the oil.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Fried_Green_Peppers_(Piperies_Tiganites)" target="_blank">Fried Green Peppers (Piperies Tiganites)</a></strong></p><p>

Olive oil for frying<br>
8-12 small green Italian frying peppers, or similar mild green pepper<br>
3-4 Tbs (46-60 ml) red wine vinegar<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

Heat about 1/4 inch (5 mm) oil in a heavy skillet over moderate heat and fry the peppers, turning occasionally, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and transfer to a serving plate. Sprinkle with vinegar, salt, and pepper and serve immediately or refrigerate and serve cold. Serves 4 to 6.</p></div>

You can call it <em>calamari</em> if you're in Italy, <em>calamares</em> if your waiter speaks Spanish, or <em>kalamarakia</em> if you're dining on Crete. By any other name, it's still squid, and it's one of my favorites.</p></div>
<div><p><strong><a name="Fried_Squid_(Kalamarakia)" target="_blank">Fried Squid (Kalamarakia)</a></strong></p><p>

Vegetable oil for deep frying<br>
4 lbs (1.8 Kg) small squid, cleaned and cut into 1/2-inch (1 cm) rings<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
1 cup (250 ml) all-purpose flour<br>
Lemons wedges for garnish</p><p>

In a heavy 10- to 12-inch (25 to 30 cm) skillet, heat 1 to 2 inches (2 to 5 cm) of oil until hot but not smoking, or until it reaches a temperature of 375F (190C) on a deep-frying thermometer. Wash the squid under cold running water and pat them completely dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the squid liberally with salt and pepper. Pour the flour into a shallow bowl (a pie plate is perfect) and drop the squid into the flour a small handful at a time. Toss to coat thoroughly and shake the squid in a small sieve held over the flour to remove the excess. Drop the squid into the hot oil carefully and fry for about 2 minutes, until they turn a light golden brown - do not over cook. As each batch is done, transfer with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet covered with two or three layers of paper towels and keep warm in a preheated 200F (90C) oven while you fry the remaining batches. Mound the squid on a heated platter and garnish with the lemon wedges. Serves 6 to 8 as an appetizer, 4 to 6 as a main dish.</p></div>

This ancient dish is not only used as a dip and spread, but is often used as a sauce for meats as well. Traditionally made with exactly seven cloves of garlic, you may use fewer (or more) to suit your taste.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Garlic_Spread_(Skordalia)" target="_blank">Garlic Spread (Skordalia)</a></strong></p><p>

6 slices whole wheat or white bread, crusts removed<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) mashed potatoes<br>
7 cloves garlic, peeled<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) chopped walnuts or almonds<br>
1 cup (250 ml) extra virgin olive oil<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) lemon juice (or to taste)<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

Soak the bread in water, then squeeze it to remove as much water as possible. Combine it with the potatoes, garlic, and nuts in an electric food processor and process until it becomes a smooth paste. With the processor running, add the olive oil in a thin stream. Add the lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Serve with pita bread and/or raw vegetables for dipping. Makes about 3 cups (750 ml).<br>
Variations: To use as a sauce for seafood, meats, or vegetables, add 1 cup (250 ml) of drained yogurt. White wine vinegar may be substituted for all or part of the lemon juice. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) ground almonds or hazelnuts.</p></div>

This ubiquitous <em>meze</em> is found in every <em>taverna</em> in the land and is especially popular in the islands and coastal areas.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Grilled_Octopus_(Oktapodi_sta_Karvuna)" target="_blank">Grilled Octopus (Oktapodi sta Karvuna)</a></strong></p><p>

1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil<br>

Grilled peppers have become a staple of the Greek kitchen since their introduction from the New World. They can be used in the preparation of many other dishes, or they can stand alone as a first course or side dish.</p></div>
<div><p><strong><a name="Grilled_Peppers_(Piperies_Psites)" target="_blank">Grilled Peppers (Piperies Psites)</a></strong></p><p>

2 lbs (900 g) red and/or green bell peppers (capsicums)<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) extra-virgin olive oil<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) red wine vinegar, or to taste<br>
1-3 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br>
1/2 tsp (2 ml) dry mustard<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

Grill the peppers over hot coals or under a broiler, turning occasionally, until charred and blistered on all sides. Transfer to a covered bowl or paper bag and let rest for 10 minutes. Peel the peppers (the skins should slide off easily), remove and discard the cores and seeds, and slice each pepper lengthwise into 3 or 4 strips. Whisk together the remaining ingredients and pour over the peppers while they are still warm. Serve chilled or at room temperature. Serves 4 to 6.<br>
Variations: Lemon juice may be substituted for all or part of the vinegar. Red pepper flakes or chopped fresh or dried oregano or thyme may be added.</p></div>

Dishes similar to this are made throughout the Middle East, usually using fava beans (broad beans), but in Greece it is traditionally made from yellow split peas. Although simple to prepare, it requires some attention because the beans will scorch quickly on the bottom of the pot if not stirred frequently. If you aren't attentive you will discover why the Greeks say of any poorly cooked dish, "It tastes as bad as burned fava."</p><p>

<strong><a name="Mashed_Peas_(Fava)" target="_blank">Mashed Peas (Fava)</a></strong></p><p>

1 lb (450 g) yellow split peas<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) salt<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) dried oregano, crushed<br>
3-4 scallions (spring onions), green and white parts, finely chopped<br>
1 cup (250 ml) chopped fresh arugula, dill, or parsley<br>
3/4 cup (180 ml) extra-virgin olive oil<br>
2 tsp (10 ml) Dijon mustard<br>
Juice of 1 lemon<br>
3 Tbs (45 ml) capers (optional)<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

Combine the split peas, salt, and oregano in a pot and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat and simmer covered, stirring frequently and adding more water if necessary, until all the water has been absorbed and the peas form a smooth paste, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl and stir to combine. The fava will thicken and can be cut into shapes for serving, or simply spooned onto a serving platter or individual plates. Spoon the sauce over the fava and serve with pita breads. Serves 6 to 8 as an appetizer, 4 to 6 as a side dish.</p></div>

Meatballs are found wherever people eat meat. They may be fried, baked, steamed, boiled, or skewered and grilled, and are prized everywhere for their versatility. This is a favorite version from the island of Corfu.</p></div>
<div><p><strong><a name="Mint-Flavored_Meatballs_(Keftedakia)" target="_blank">Mint-Flavored Meatballs (Keftedakia)</a></strong></p><p>

2 thick slices bread, trimmed of crust and torn into small pieces<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) ouzo (or substitute another anise-flavored liqueur)<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) olive oil<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) finely chopped onion<br>
1 lb (450 g) lean ground beef<br>
1 egg<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) finely chopped fresh mint leaves, or 1 tsp (5 ml) dried mint<br>
1 clove garlic, finely chopped<br>
1/2 tsp (2 ml) dried oregano<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
1 cup (250 ml) all-purpose flour</p><p>

Soak the bread in the ouzo for 10 minutes. Heat 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of the olive oil in a skillet over moderate heat, add the onions, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until tender but not brown. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon, placing them in a large mixing bowl. Squeeze the bread dry (discard the ouzo) and add the bread to the onions. Add the ground beef, egg, mint, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, and knead vigorously with your hands. Beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture is smooth and fluffy. Shape the mixture into balls about the size of walnuts (you may find that wetting your hands with water helps prevent sticking) and then roll them in the flour to coat evenly. Place on a cookie sheet and refrigerate for at least one hour. Add the remaining olive oil to a large skillet and brown the meatballs, 7 or 8 at a time, over high heat, cooking 8 to 10 minutes and shaking the pan from time to time. As each batch is done, remove them with a slotted spoon and place on an ovenproof serving platter. Keep them warm in a 200F (100C) oven while you finish cooking the rest. Serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer or first course (about 30 meatballs).</p></div>

No Greek table is complete without a dish of olives, and no assortment of <em>mezedes</em> would be complete without one or two varieties. They are usually served straight from the barrel of brine they were cured in, but they are often dressed as described here.</p></div>
<div><p><strong><a name="Olives_(Elies)" target="_blank">Olives (Elies)</a></strong></p><p>

Green olives may be marinated with ladolemono, the Greek vinaigrette consisting of two parts of the best olive oil and one part fresh lemon juice. Dried oregano, mustard, red pepper flakes, fresh parsley or dill, or chopped scallions (spring onions) or capers may also be added. Black olives are often tossed with finely chopped garlic and fresh oregano, and the wrinkled black throumbes olives often sold as "oil-cured" benefit from a dressing of olive oil and dried rosemary, oregano, and thyme. Olives become perishable when they're removed from their brine, so store marinated olives in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p><p>


The Greeks have a variety of <em>salates</em> that can be used either as spreads or dips and are often served as an appetizer. This one combines the bright flavor and green color of fresh parsley for a delicious and unusual dip.</p><p>

<strong><a name="Parsley_Spread_(Maidanosalata)" target="_blank">Parsley Spread (Maidanosalata)</a></strong></p><p>

1 thick slice (1 inch, 3 cm) rustic white or whole<br>
wheat bread, crusts removed and soaked in water<br>
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped<br>
2-4 cloves garlic, chopped<br>
1 lb (450 g) fresh parsley, stems trimmed<br>
1/3 cup (80 ml) extra-virgin olive oil<br>
3 Tbs (45 ml) lemon juice<br>
1 tsp (5 ml) balsamic vinegar<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
Crushed red pepper flakes to taste (optional)<br>
Black olives for garnish</p><p>

Squeeze and discard the excess water from the bread and combine the bread with the remaining ingredients except the olives in an electric blender or food processor. Process until a smooth paste is formed. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking with additional salt, pepper, lemon juice, or vinegar. Spoon into a serving bowl and arrange the olives on top. Serve with pita bread, raw vegetables, or crackers. Makes about 2 cups (500 ml).</p></div>

It's not uncommon, even in the most popular <em>tavernas</em>, to be served several canned or processed tidbits along with the specialties of the house. Indeed, there is a flourishing industry in Greece dedicated to providing a variety of preserved seafood, vegetable, and meat products designed to be eaten as <em>mezedes</em> directly from the can or jar. Whenever possible, buy products imported from Greece for the most authentic flavors. Not all of these quick appetizers are pre-packaged, so go ahead and combine fresh and processed ingredients to make your own eclectic assortment.</p></div>

As with <em>taramosalata</em> and <em>maidanosalata</em>, this spread can also be used to top boiled vegetables.</p><p>

<strong><a name="Sardine_Spread_(Sardelosalata)" target="_blank">Sardine Spread (Sardelosalata)</a></strong></p><p>

1/2 cup (125 ml) salted sardines or anchovies, rinsed and chopped<br>

The Greek dinner, which usually doesn't start until 11 PM, doesn't traditionally include appetizers of first courses. Rather, a wide variety of dishes known and <em>mezedes</em>, which can be eaten at any time of day, are often served with drinks before dinner. This simple shrimp dish might be found in any restaurant or <em>taverna</em> in Greece:</p><p>

<strong><a name="Skewered_Shrimp_(Garides_Souvlakia)" target="_blank">Skewered Shrimp (Garides Souvlakia)</a></strong></p><p>

1 lb (450 g) shrimp, peeled<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) lemon juice<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) grated Parmesan cheese</p><p>

Thread the shrimp on wooden skewers, putting 3 to 4 on each skewer. Sprinkle with the lemon juice, olive oil, and the cheese. Cook under a preheated broiler until firm and opaque, about 2 minutes per side. Serves 4 to 6.</p></div>

Many Greek women gather fresh grape leaves from the vineyards and store them in the freezer without any other means of preservation. Unfortunately, the grape leaves available to the rest of us usually come packed in brine and have lost most of their distinctive flavor. This traditional <em>meze</em> may be served with a variety of sauces - egg-lemon sauce (see index) is a favorite - and are often served as a main dish.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Stuffed_Grape_Leaves_(Dolmades)" target="_blank">Stuffed Grape Leaves (Dolmades)</a></strong></p><p>

4 Tbs (60 ml) olive oil<br>
1 medium onion, finely chopped<br>
1 - 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br>
1/3 cup (80 ml) uncooked rice<br>
3/4 cup (180 ml) water<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) pine nuts (pignoli), toasted<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) dried currants or raisins<br>
40 preserved grape leaves*<br>
Lemon wedges for garnish</p><p>

* Available in jars or cans in finer supermarkets and Middle Eastern specialty shops.<br>
Heat half the oil in a skillet over moderate heat and saute the onion and garlic until tender but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir for 2 minutes. Add the water, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer tightly covered for 15 minutes, until the rice is tender. Add the pine nuts and currants. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the grape leaves. Remove from the heat immediately and allow to sit for 1 minute.</p><p>

Drain the grape leaves and rinse in cold water. Separate the leaves and pat dry with paper towels. Layer the bottom of a heavy baking dish with 10 of the grape leaves. Place about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the rice mixture on each of the remaining 30 grape leaves and roll up burrito fashion, folding the sides of the leaves over the filling as you roll to make compact tight bundles. Place the rolled leaves seam side down in the baking dish and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Add a few tablespoons of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer tightly covered for 45 minutes. Serve warm, chilled, or at room temperature, garnished with lemon wedges. Serves 6 to 8.</p></div>

Fritters of many kinds are found all over Greece, and tomato fritters are especially popular in the Aegean islands because of the rich flavor of the tomatoes that grow in the dry, hot climate. <em>Domatokeftedes</em> can be served as an appetizer or as a side dish, and many people enjoy them cold, even long after their crispness has faded.</p></div>
<div><p><strong><a name="Tomato_Fritters_(Domatokeftedes)" target="_blank">Tomato Fritters (Domatokeftedes)</a></strong></p><p>

Olive oil for frying<br>
1 medium onion, finely chopped<br>
1-3 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br>
3 cups (750 ml) peeled, seeded and chopped fresh tomatoes (4 to 6 tomatoes)<br>
1 cup (250 ml) finely chopped fresh parsley<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) chopped scallions (spring onions), green and white parts<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) finely chopped fresh mint leaves<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) dried oregano<br>
About 1 cup (250 ml) all-purpose flour<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) baking powder<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

Heat a little oil in a skillet over moderate heat and saute the onion and garlic until tender but not brown, about 3 minutes. Combine with the remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir to form a thick batter, adding a little more flour if necessary. Heat about 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) oil in a skillet over moderate heat and fry the batter by tablespoonfuls until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve hot. Serves 6 to 8.</p></div>

Yogurt makes an appearance at almost every Greek meal, usually as a supporting actor in meat and vegetable dishes. Here is gets the star treatment in a dip that can also be used as a sauce for seafood, chicken, and vegetables.</p></div>
<div><p><strong><a name="Yogurt_Dip_(Yaourti_Meze)" target="_blank">Yogurt Dip (Yaourti Meze)</a></strong></p><p>

2 cups (500 ml) yogurt<br>

1 tsp (5 ml) chopped fresh dill (optional)<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

Combine all the ingredients, stirring to mix thoroughly. Serve with pita bread, raw vegetables, or crackers. Makes about 2 cups (500 ml).</p></div>

<p>Don't be thrown by the word caviar in the name of this dish. The fish roe in question is sold refrigerated in glass jars in many supermarkets and Middle Eastern specialty shops at a very reasonable price. After all, this is everyday fare in the Aegean.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Caviar_Spread_(Taramosalata)" target="_blank">Caviar Spread (Taramosalata)</a></strong></p><p>

4 oz (100 g) tarama (carp roe)<br>
1 small onion, finely grated<br>
1 egg yolk<br>
4 slices white bread (stale)<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) lemon juice<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</p><p>

Note: This recipe calls for an uncooked egg yolk. If salmonella contamination is a concern to you, use pasteurized eggs or 2 Tbs (30 ml) egg substitute.<br>
Combine the tarama, onion, and egg yolk in the jar of an electric blender and process at low speed until smooth. Remove and discard the crust from the bread and soak the bread in water for 5 minutes. Squeeze as much of the water out of the bread as you can. Break it into small pieces and add it to the roe mixture. Process until well blended. Add the lemon juice and olive oil alternately in thin streams while the blender is running at medium speed. Process at high speed, scraping down the sides of the jar as necessary, until well combined. Serve with pita bread or raw vegetables. Makes about 1 1/2 cups (375 ml).</p></div>

<p>The thing we know as Greek salad in the United States is called <em>horiatiki</em> in Greek, which translates as "country" or "village" salad. They are served in, literally, every <em>taverna</em> in the country, and often contain no more than tomatoes, onions, feta, and a generous drizzle of fresh green olive oil from a cruet on the table. Other variations include cucumbers, olives, bell peppers, hard-cooked eggs, capers, sardines, and several other options, but I prefer the simpler versions. Keep in mind that this salad will be no better than its ingredients, so be sure to use the freshest home-grown tomatoes and best Greek olive oil available if you want an authentic taste of the Aegean.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Country_Salad_(Horiatiki)" target="_blank">Country Salad (Horiatiki)</a></strong></p><p>

1 tsp (5 ml) chopped fresh oregano leaves<br>
(do not substitute dried oregano), optional<br>

This dish is known throughout the Mediterranean where it goes by several names, including "poor man's caviar" and "Provençal caviar." For best results, make it a day ahead and let the flavors mature in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Eggplant_Spread_(Melitzanosalata)" target="_blank">Eggplant Spread (Melitzanosalata)</a></strong></p><p>

2 medium eggplants, about 1 lb (450 g) each<br>
4 Tbs (60 ml) lemon juice<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) chopped fresh parsley<br>
4 garlic cloves, crushed through a press or chopped very fine<br>
Crushed red pepper flakes to taste<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

Wrap the eggplants in aluminum foil and bake in a 400F (200C) oven for one hour, until very soft. Unwrap carefully and allow the eggplants to cool before handling. Scrape the softened eggplant out of the skins and place in a food processor or blender. Add the remaining ingredients and puree until smooth. Transfer to a serving bowl and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Serve cold as a dip with crackers or crudités, or as a spread on melba toast or thinly sliced bread. Serves 8 as an appetizer.</p></div>
<p>Variations: To use as a sauce add 1 cup (250 ml) drained yogurt. To make a coarser spread, use a food mill or mash the ingredients with a potato masher instead of using an electric food processor.</p>

Although the Greeks tend to eat more artichokes than the average American, artichokes are readily available almost year round in most parts of the country. Use only the very smallest and youngest artichokes for this unusual recipe.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Raw_Artichoke_Salad_(Aginares_Salata)" target="_blank">Raw Artichoke Salad (Aginares Salata)</a></strong></p><p>

For the artichokes:<br>
Juice of 2 lemons<br>
4 cups (2 L) water<br>
8-12 small artichokes, no larger than 2 inches<br>
(5 cm) in diameter</p><p>

For the dressing:<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) lemon juice<br>
1 tsp (5 ml) Dijon mustard<br>
1 clove garlic, finely chopped<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) chopped fresh dill</p><p>

Combine the lemon juice and water in a bowl and keep the artichokes in it after you have prepared them. Remove and discard the hard outer leaves of the artichokes and snap the remaining leaves off until you have the yellow-green cone formed by the inner leaves. Trim the top of the cone with a knife and quarter the artichokes. Scoop out and discard the fuzzy choke in the center and keep the artichokes in the acidulated water until ready to serve. Immediately before serving, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper. Drain the artichokes and toss them with the dressing. Garnish with chopped dill. Serves 4 to 6.</p></div>

<div><p><strong><a name="Egg_Lemon_Soup_(Avgolemono_Soupa)" target="_blank">Egg Lemon Soup (Avgolemono Soupa)</a></strong></p><p>

6 cups (1.5 L) chicken, beef, or vegetable stock<br>
3 eggs<br>
Juice of 1-2 lemons<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) cornstarch (cornflour)</p><p>

Bring the stock to a simmer over moderate heat. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl, adding the lemon juice and cornstarch gradually - the eggs should be very well beaten but not frothy. Slowly add about 1 cup (250 ml) of the hot stock to the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Stir the egg mixture into the broth and stir constantly until the soup thickens slightly, about 3 minutes - do not boil. Taste and add more lemon juice if desired - the soup should have a pronounced but not sour lemon taste. Serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.<br>

The traditional method of cooking vegetables in Greece is not for dieters. Cooked in plenty of oil or butter, the vegetables are simmered until all the liquids except the fat are absorbed, resulting in a delicious, fat-laden dish. I have reduced the amount of oil in this recipe, but it is still a primary source of flavor so please make sure you use only the best olive oil.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Cauliflower_Stifado_(Kounoupithi_Stifado)" target="_blank">Cauliflower Stifado (Kounoupithi Stifado)</a></strong></p><p>

I didn't know what to call this dish in English. It's sort of like a pie, but there's no crust. It's sort of like an Italian frittata, but the emphasis is more on the vegetables than the eggs.

Sprinkle the eggplant slices generously with salt and place in a colander for 15 minutes. Rinse the eggplant and pat dry. Place the eggplant slices on a greased baking sheet and brush generously with olive oil. Place under a preheated broiler and broil until lightly browned, about 5 minutes per side. Meanwhile, combine the ingredients for the sauce in an electric blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Layer half the eggplant slices in a greased baking dish and spread half the sauce over them. Repeat with the remaining eggplant and sauce and top with the grated cheese. Bake in a preheated 350F (180C) oven until bubbling and lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Serves 4 to 6 as a side dish, 2 to 3 as a main dish.</p></div>

This is the most common way of cooking vegetables in Greece, and when this method is used elsewhere it is usually called <em>à la Grecque</em>, or "in the Greek style." Just about any vegetable can be used, whether they're fresh, frozen, or canned.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Greek-Style_Vegetables_(Salataki_Ladolemono)" target="_blank">Greek-Style Vegetables (Salataki Ladolemono)</a></strong></p><p>

1 1/2 - 2 lbs (675-900 g) any vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, summer and winter squashes, leeks, okra, bell peppers, carrots, and all the green leafy vegetables such a spinach, kale, or turnip greens, peeled as appropriate and cut into chunks or bite-sized pieces<br>
1-2 scallions (spring onions), chopped<br>
1 tsp (5 ml) chopped fresh oregano or 1/2 tsp (2 ml) dried<br>
1 tsp (5 ml) chopped fresh mint or 1/2 tsp (2 ml) dried<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil<br>
The juice of 1 lemon<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

Boil the vegetables in salted water until very tender - the Greeks like their vegetables very well cooked. If using frozen vegetables, increase the cooking time on the package instructions by several minutes. Drain the vegetables and sprinkle with the chopped scallions and herbs. Drizzle with the olive oil, lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Serve warm, chilled, or at room temperature. Serves 4 to 6.</p></div>

Okra is far more popular in Greece and parts of the Middle East than it is in the USA, and many Greeks grow it in their summer gardens. As with all Greek vegetable dishes, this may be served hot but you'll find it served at room temperature in most homes and restaurants.</p></div>
<div><p><strong><a name="Okra_in_Tomato_Sauce_(Bamies_Latheres)" target="_blank">Okra in Tomato Sauce (Bamies Latheres)</a></strong></p><p>

2 lbs (900 g) fresh okra, trimmed, or frozen okra, thawed<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) red wine vinegar<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) salt<br>

According to a contemporary Greek legend, potatoes were introduced into Greece in the early nineteenth century by Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first governor after Greece obtained its independence from Turkey. Kapodistrias knew that potatoes would provide valuable nutrition to his starving nation, but the people wouldn't try them. The clever governor then put a large basket of potatoes on the docks along with an armed guard and a warning that anyone caught stealing them would be shot. The next morning, all the potatoes were gone. True or not, potatoes are now popular throughout Greece, as demonstrated by this dish that could only have originated there.</p></div>

1 tsp (5 ml) dried oregano<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
Chopped fresh parsley for garnish</p><p>

Heat the oil in a large skillet over moderate heat and brown the potatoes on all sides - they do not need to be cooked through. Transfer the potatoes to a baking dish in a single layer. Saute the onion in the same skillet until tender but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and saute for 1 minute. Add the remaining ingredients except the parsley (careful with the salt because the olives might be salty) and bring to a boil. Pour over the potatoes and bake in a preheated 375F (190C) oven until the potatoes are cooked through, 30 to 45 minutes, adding more liquid if needed. Serve hot garnished with chopped parsley.

If Greece had a national dish, this would be it. I believe moussaka was served in every restaurant I ever ate in while in Greece, and once you have tasted it you will see why it is so popular. Naturally, every recipe is different, and every cook has a special way of preparing it. Some versions include potatoes or squash, but my recipe is for what I think of as the "classic" eggplant moussaka. Traditionally the eggplant is fried in olive oil before being assembled with the other ingredients, and anyone who has ever fried eggplant will marvel at the amount of oil it soaks up. My method involves less work and considerably less oil, resulting in a lighter, more healthy dish.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Moussaka" target="_blank" id="Moussaka">Moussaka</a></strong></p><p>

2 Tbs olive oil<br>
1 1/2 lbs (750 g) ground lamb or beef<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) chopped onion<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) white wine or water<br>
3 Tbs (45 ml) tomato paste<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) chopped parsley<br>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br>
3 lbs (1.5 Kg) eggplant (aubergine)<br>
4 to 6 Tbs (60 to 90 ml) olive oil<br>
1 recipe Béchamel sauce (see below)<br>
1 cup (250 ml) bread crumbs<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) grated Parmesan cheese<br>
3 Tbs (45 ml) melted butter</p><p>

Heat the 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the chopped meat and onion and brown, stirring frequently to crumble the meat. Add the wine or water, tomato paste, parsley, salt, and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer covered for 30 minutes, until most of the liquid has been reduced. Meanwhile, cut the eggplant into slices 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick and arrange on baking sheets. Brush both sides with olive oil and bake in a preheated 350F (180C) oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until the eggplant is tender. Arrange half the eggplant slices in the bottom of a medium-sized baking dish. Sprinkle with half the bread crumbs. Spread the meat mixture over the eggplant, followed by half the Parmesan. Add another layer of eggplant, followed by the béchamel. Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan and bread crumbs on top, and drizzle with the melted butter. Bake in a preheated 350F (180C) oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until the top is lightly browned. Serves 6 to 8.</p></div>
<div><p><strong>Béchamel Sauce</strong></p><p>

6 Tbs (90 ml) butter<br>
8 Tbs (120 ml) flour<br>
4 cups (1 L) milk<br>
Salt and white pepper to taste<br>
A grating of fresh nutmeg</p><p>

Melt the butter in a saucepan over moderate heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until it has lost the floury aroma. Do not allow to brown. Add the milk and stir, making sure to dissolve any lumps that have formed. Heat, stirring frequently, until the sauce boils and becomes thick. Add the salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Makes 4 cups (1 L).</p></div>

I think there is a large pan of <em>pastitsio</em> sitting on the stove of every restaurant and <em>taverna</em> in Greece, and no two are exactly the same. The Greeks usually use a long, hollow pasta similar to bucatini, but elbow macaroni can be used with equally good results.</p></div>
<div><p><strong><a name="Pastitsio" target="_blank" id="Pastitsio">Pastitsio</a></strong></p><p>

For the meat sauce:<br>
4 Tbs (60 ml) butter<br>
2 medium onions, chopped<br>
1 lb (450 g) ground beef<br>
1 lb (450 g) ground lamb<br>
2 cups (500 ml) tomato sauce<br>
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) chopped fresh parsley<br>
1/2 tsp (2 ml) dried oregano<br>
1/2 tsp (2 ml) cinnamon<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

For the béchamel sauce:<br>
4 Tbs (60 ml) butter<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) all-purpose flour<br>
3 cups (750 ml) milk<br>
6 eggs, thoroughly beaten<br>
A grating of fresh nutmeg<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p><p>

1 lb (450 g) bucatini or elbow macaroni<br>
1 cup (250 ml) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p><p>

To make the meat sauce, heat the butter in a skillet over moderate heat and saute the onion until tender but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add the beef and lamb and saute until browned. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer. Cook covered over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, to make the béchamel sauce, heat the butter in a saucepan over moderate heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the milk and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and stir some of the milk mixture into the beaten eggs. Stir the egg mixture into the milk mixture and season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cook the pasta in salted water until slightly under-done, about 8 minutes. Drain and place half the cooked pasta in a greased 3-quart (3 L) baking dish. Sprinkle with half the cheese and spread all of the meat sauce over the top. Add the remaining pasta, all of the béchamel sauce, and the remaining cheese. Bake in a preheated 350F (180C) oven until the top is browned and bubbling, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before cutting into serving portions. Serves 6 to 8.</p></div>

This is honest to goodness one of my favorite dishes, and a perfect centerpiece for any Greek menu.

Mix the cornstarch (cornflour) in 1/4 cup water and add to the eggs. Add the lemon juice and beat the mixture well. Temper the sauce by slowly adding some of the hot liquid from the meat to the egg-lemon mixture, beating it in thoroughly. Pour the egg-lemon mixture over the meat and shake the pan gently over low heat until the sauce thickens. DO NOT BOIL. Serve immediately. Serves 6 to 8.</p></div>

It really takes only two ingredients to conjure up the flavors of Greece: lemon and oregano. This simple method of cooking chicken is as old as the hills and can be used with fish and shellfish as well.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Roasted_Lemon_Chicken_(Psiti_Kota_meh_Lemoni)" target="_blank">Roasted Lemon Chicken (Psiti Kota meh Lemoni)</a></strong></p><p>

2 cups (500 ml) boiling water<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) cornstarch (cornflour) mixed with<br>
1/4 cup (60 ml) cold water</p><p>

Combine the butter and olive oil in a small pot and heat gently until the butter is melted. Place half the mixture in a roasting pan. Season the chicken pieces with the oregano, salt, and pepper, and place in the pan. Combine the lemon juice with the remaining butter mixture and baste the chicken with it. Bake the chicken in a 375F (190C) oven, basting several times, until the skin is crispy and the chicken is cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a platter and add the boiling water to the roasting pan, scraping the bottom to dissolve the brown bits. Transfer the liquid to a small pot over moderate heat and stir in the cornstarch mixture. Add any remaining basting liquid and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and serve the gravy along with the chicken. Serves 4 to 6.</p></div>

Thessaly is a part of Eastern Greece bordering on the Aegean Sea, and this is one of their favorite ways of cooking the seafood that is plentiful there.

With the exception of the natural oils in the almonds, these sweet treats are fat-free and guilt-free.</p>

In Greece, where fresh apricots are more plentiful than in most parts of the world, only fresh will do. I have modified the recipe for the benefit of those of us with easier access to canned apricots, but keep in mind that fresh peaches, cherries, apples, or strawberries could be substituted, along with an appropriate change of preserves.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Apricot_Pie" target="_blank" id="Apricot_Pie">Apricot Pie</a></strong></p><p>

1 pie crust, frozen or made from your favorite recipe<br>
2 Lbs (1 Kg) fresh or canned apricot halves, drained<br>
1 1/2 cups (375 ml) apricot jam or preserves<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) sugar<br>
2 Tbs (30 ml) melted butter<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) hot water<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) cognac (optional, substitute water)</p><p>

Bake the pie crust in a 9 inch (22 cm) pie pan for about 15 minutes in a preheated 350F (180C) oven, until it is about half baked. Spread about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the apricot jam over the bottom of the pie crust in a thin layer. Add the apricots and sprinkle them with the sugar and drizzle with the melted butter. Return to the oven for an additional 20 minutes. Dissolve the remaining jam in the hot water and add the cognac. Pour this mixture over the apricots as soon as the pie is removed from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature before serving. Makes one 9 inch (22 cm) pie.</p></div>

<em>Lambropsomo</em>, the traditional Greek Easter bread, may or may not incorporate eggs that have been hard boiled and dyed red; usually one egg is centered in a round leaf with a cross formed over it, or four red eggs will be nestled into a braided loaf. This recipe calls for one loaf of each of these shapes. In some households the same bread without the red egg decoration is baked and served on Sunday throughout the year.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Easter_Bread_(Lambropsomo)" target="_blank">Easter Bread (Lambropsomo)</a></strong></p><p>

2 Tbs (2 packets, 30 ml) active dry yeast<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) warm water<br>
1 cup (250 ml) warm milk<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) melted butter<br>
2 tsp (10 ml) coarse salt or 1 tsp (5 ml) table salt<br>
2 tsp (10 ml) anise seed, crushed<br>
3 eggs, beaten<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) sugar<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) grated orange rind<br>
About 6 cups (1.5 L) white flour, preferably unbleached<br>
2-5 hard boiled eggs, dyed red</p><p>

For the glaze:<br>
Soft butter<br>
Sesame seeds (optional)</p><p>

In a large bowl mix yeast with warm water, then stir in milk, butter and salt. Add the anise seed, the beaten eggs, the sugar, and grated orange peel. Keep stirring while adding the flour. When the mixture is stiff, turn out on a floured surface and knead about 10 minutes, until smooth and satiny. Clean the bowl and grease it well. Put the dough in the bowl, and turn so all surfaces are oiled; cover with plastic and let rise about 2 hours, until doubled. Punch the dough down, knead briefly and divide in half to make the two different shapes (or make two loaves of the same shape if you prefer). To make a round loaf with a cross with one half of the dough, first tear off a piece of dough, about one-fifth the whole amount. Form the larger piece into a round and put it on a greased baking sheet. Center one red egg on the top of the round. Divide the reserved piece in half and roll out 2 long strips. Place these over the egg in the form of a cross, tucking the ends under the loaf. To make a braided crown with the other half, divide the dough in thirds and roll out into ropes at least 2 feet (60 cm) long. Braid the ropes together, pinching the ends securely and then form into a circle on a greased baking sheet, pinching again the ends where they overlap. Nestle 4 red eggs in among the braids. Cover both loaves with a kitchen towel and let rise 1 hour. Bake in a preheated 350F (180C) oven for 30 minutes. Remove and brush immediately with butter, then sprinkle on optional sesame seeds. Makes 2 round loaves.</p></div>

A Greek menu just wouldn't be complete without baklava. This classic pastry is easier to make than you might think, provided you can buy phyllo in your area. It is widely available in the US, usually sold frozen in most supermarkets. Elsewhere you may have to seek out a Greek or Middle Eastern specialty shop. Even if you have to go to some lengths to find it, you will agree it was worth the trouble after you take your first bite of this delight.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Walnut_Baklava_(Baklavas)" target="_blank">Walnut Baklava (Baklavas)</a></strong></p><p>

4 cups (1 L) chopped walnuts<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) sugar<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) ground cinnamon<br>
1 1/4 cups (310 ml) melted butter<br>
1 1/2 lbs (700 g) phyllo</p><p>

The syrup<br>
4 cups (1 L) sugar<br>
3 cups (750 ml) water<br>
1 1/2 cups (375 ml) honey<br>
1 cinnamon stick<br>
5 to 6 whole cloves</p><p>

Mix together the walnuts, sugar and cinnamon. Select a pan the size of the phyllo sheets and brush well with melted butter. Use 4 sheets of phyllo for the bottom layer, brushing each one with butter before adding the next, and top with a sheet of unbuttered phyllo. Sprinkle with a handful of the walnut mixture. Cover with a buttered sheet, an unbuttered sheet, and another sprinkling of walnuts. Repeat until the ingredients are used up, reserving 5 sheet of phyllo for the top layer. Brush each of the top 5 sheets with ample butter, and pour the remaining butter over the top of the last sheet. Trim the edges if necessary, and cut the baklava into the traditional diamond pattern. Do not cut through the bottom layer. Sprinkle the top of the baklava lightly with water from your fingertips. Bake in a pre-heated 250F (120C) for about 1 hour. Remove from oven and cool. For the syrup, combine the sugar and water in a large pot and boil for 5 minutes. Add the honey, cinnamon stick and cloves, and boil for 5 minutes more. Pour the hot syrup over the cooled baklava. Do not pour over a hot baklava, it will turn soggy. Cool then cut through the bottom layer of phyllo following the previous cuts.</p></div>

I have called this recipe a cake, although the Greek "pittes," of which this is an example, is probably best translated as "pies." Or we could call it a torte. Regardless of what it's called, I'm sure you will agree that it tastes great.</p>
<div><p><strong><a name="Walnut_Cake_(Karidopita)" target="_blank">Walnut Cake (Karidopita)</a></strong></p><p>

4 cups (1 L) all-purpose flour<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) powdered cloves<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) baking powder<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) white raisins (sultanas)<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) dark raisins<br>
1 cup (250 ml) vegetable oil<br>
1 1/2 cups (375 ml) sugar<br>
2 cups (500 ml) water<br>
1 tsp (5 ml) baking soda<br>
1/2 cup (125 ml) cognac or apple juice<br>
1 Tbs (15 ml) grated lemon peel<br>
1 1/2 cups (375 ml) chopped walnuts<br>
Confectioner's (powdered) sugar and cinnamon for dusting</p><p>

Sift the flour, cloves, and baking powder into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle a little of this mixture over the raisins to prevent them from sticking together. Add the oil to the flour mixture and rub between the palms of your hands until well blended. Make a well in the center of the flour and oil mixture, and add the sugar, water, and the baking soda dissolved in the cognac or apple juice. Mix lightly, then add the lemon peel, raisins, and nuts and mix well. Pour into a greased baking pan and bake in a preheated 350F (180C) oven for 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with confectioner's sugar and cinnamon. Cut into squares and serve warm or at room temperature.</p></div>
